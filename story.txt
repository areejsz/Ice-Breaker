1. Dr. Bradshaw went down to the ratskeller for the 6th time today, it was the beginning of a long day at city hall.
2. He went to the Hauptstrasse for a walk and met a girl wearing Dirndel.
3. He felt something special from the first glance at her, it was as if he was hit by a waterfall of emotion that made him blurt out "wettbewerbsfaehig" randomly.
4. However, she didn't speak German and thought it was an insult; so she responded with, "Go Schloss yourself". 
5. Saddened with this outcome, the doc hopped in his Porsche, and raced to the nearest Flughafen.
6. The backroads to Berlin were the only option, if he was caught drinking and driving again they'd surely take away his license, probably for good this time.
