Dr. Bradshaw went down to the ratskeller for the 6th time today, it was the beginning of a long day at city hall. He went to the Hauptstrasse for a walk and met a girl wearing Dirndel.
He felt something special from the first glance at her, it was as if he was hit by a waterfall of emotion that made him blurt out "wettbewerbsfaehig" randomly.
